## Created by
Justin Thoreson a.k.a. Exulgor

## Description
My personal portfolio website portraying elements of my background including education, experience, and projects.

## Style 
The scanlines and flickering provide the illusion that the website is being displayed on a retro cathode-ray tube monitor. Furthermore, the colors lime, black, and white are influenced by the appearences of many command lines. The font, transitions, and animations are meant to convey a style akin to that of a video game; the background particles specifically liven the video game style by achieving an outer space effect.
